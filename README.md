Users can navigate to the menu page to view the restaurant's offerings, which are divided into categories such as appetizers, entrees, and desserts. Each menu item includes a description and price.

The website also includes a contact page, which allows users to send a message to the restaurant. The page includes a form that users can fill out with their name, email address, and message. Once the form is submitted, the message will be sent to the restaurant's email address.
